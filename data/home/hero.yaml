  text: "We at inpyjama are on a mission to lowering the barrier to entry to learning Embedded Systems. With almost a decade of experience working on lower level software (and hardware) deployed on Embedded Systems, we have insights into what works, what doesn't and how to deal with the complex systems.\n

  **There is a way to look at things**. Once you know that - the complexity disappears! We intend to teach such insights so you can excel at Embedded Software Engineering."
