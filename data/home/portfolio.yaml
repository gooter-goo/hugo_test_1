    title: "C and Assembly"
    text: "In embedded systems, Assembly language is often used to program
microcontrollers or other small computers. This is because Assembly
provides a level of control and low-level manipulation that is not
possible with higher-level languages like C.
C is also commonly used in embedded systems, particularly when portability
and ease of development are important considerations. C's syntax is
similar to that of Assembly, but it provides additional features like
structured programming, variables, and pointers, which can make code more
readable and maintainable."

    title: "CPU - Architecture and ISA"
    text: "The Central Processing Unit (CPU) plays a crucial role in embedded
systems, serving as the brain that executes instructions and controls the
system's behavior. In an embedded system, the CPU manages interactions
between sensors, actuators, and other peripherals, processing data from
sensors, performing calculations, and controlling output devices. It also
handles tasks such as storing and retrieving data from memory, handling
interrupts, and executing pre-programmed instructions or algorithms to
perform specific functions. The CPU's role is often characterized by its
ability to operate in real-time, responding quickly to changing conditions
and making decisions based on the system's inputs and outputs, enabling it
to control complex systems like robots, medical devices, or autonomous
vehicles."

    title: "Operating Systems"
    text: "In embedded systems, an Operating System (OS) plays a crucial role in
managing hardware resources, such as memory, I/O devices, and peripherals,
to ensure efficient and reliable system operation. Unlike traditional
desktop or server-based OSes, embedded OSes are designed to be
lightweight, compact, and real-time capable, often using specialized
architectures and optimized for specific applications. They provide
essential services like process scheduling, memory management, and
interrupt handling, while also offering features like device drivers, file
systems, and networking protocols. In an embedded system, the OS enables
devices to interact with each other, manage data storage and retrieval,
and execute complex tasks, making it a critical component in applications
such as industrial automation, medical equipment, and automotive
electronics."

    title: "FPGAs"
    text: "Field-Programmable Gate Arrays  (FPGAs) play a unique role in embedded
systems development by providing a flexible and reconfigurable platform
for implementing custom digital logic. Unlike Application-Specific
Integrated Circuits  (ASICs), which are designed specifically for a
particular task, FPGAs can be programmed to perform a wide range of
functions, allowing developers to quickly prototype, test, and deploy
complex algorithms or protocols. In an embedded system, FPGAs can be used
to accelerate specific tasks, such as signal processing, encryption, or
compression, while also reducing power consumption and increasing system
reliability. Additionally, FPGAs can serve as a bridge between software
and hardware development, allowing developers to implement algorithms in
software and then optimize them for hardware execution on the FPGA before
implementing them in an ASIC."

    title: "Build Tools"
    text: "Built tools such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) play a crucial role in
embedded systems development by providing a means to compile, assemble,
and link code for microcontrollers and other embedded processors. GCC is
particularly well-suited for embedded systems due to its ability to
generate optimized machine code for specific target architectures, taking
into account the limited resources and constraints of these devices. With
GCC, developers can write C or assembly language code on a host platform
and then compile it to run natively on an embedded processor, without
requiring any knowledge of low-level programming languages or
hardware-specific details. This allows developers to focus on implementing
the system's logic and functionality, rather than worrying about the
intricacies of the target processor. Additionally, GCC provides features
such as debugging symbols, profiling information, and optimization options
that can be used to fine-tune code performance and debug issues in
embedded systems."
